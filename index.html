Hi! I'm Khushi and some people call me sushi lol! One of <br>
my biggest dreams is to go study aboard to Japan <br>
because anime has inspired me. Japan is such a beautiful country! <br> 
I dont want to go Japan just only because anime inspired me but also <br>
because how forward and pretty the country is. <br> I alway wish i can go to study to Japan asap!
